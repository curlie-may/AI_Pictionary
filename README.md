AI pictionary game using camera 

I’m super excited about an AI Pictionary game that I vibe-coded.

What’s needed for the game is a computer, something to draw on (a white background is best), something to draw with, and a webcam pointed toward your drawing surface.  Here I have an external webcam connected to my computer.  

The game starts by opening the app link.  I wanted the GUI to have simple clean interfaces.  

Press Start Game. 

If you have more than one webcam connected you can choose which one to use.  In this case I have a laptop and external webcams connected so I’ll choose the external one.  

The preview window let’s you place your drawing sheet.  

The game begins with a word that’s been generated by an AI Agent called Gen_Word_Agent.  For this round the word is “Octopus”.  

I’ll start the timer and the second AI Agent called Guess_Agent has 60 seconds to guess what I’m drawing. 

Let’s try it out.  

I have a final Agent called the Judge_Agent who has to determine things like, if the word is “Cat” and the Guesser said “Feline” that’s correct.  

Then there’s the option to play again.  

One observation I made is that the Guess_Agent appears to recognizes color.  I saw that when the word was cactus. It thought I drew a hand but I colored the outline in green and it immediately said plant.  Wasn’t the correct word but the added color information pointed it in the right direction.

AI Pictionary
I want to create an AI Pictionary game.  The game setup will have a piece of paper that the person draws on.  A camera is connected to the computer (webcam) through a USB port and shows what is being drawn on the paper.
1). The game begins by the player pressing a button “Start Game”.  A word is generated by the program and is shown on the screen.  The word should not just be pulled from a list.  The word is generated by an AI Agent (Word_Gen_Agent) that understands that the word will be drawn.  It should therefore be an object and not something abstract.  This Word_Gen_Agent should generate words that are different for each game.  
2).  After the word is displayed, the person presses a button that says “Start Timer”.  A countdown timer begins counting down from 60 seconds.
3). The player starts drawing the word on a piece of paper.  Another AI Agent (Guess_Agent) interprets the drawing and guesses what it is.  guesses from the Guess_Agent should be displayed on the computer screen and also be projected through the speakers so the person drawing does not need to look up from the paper. 
4). The game is over when either the Guess_Agent correctly guesses the word or the clock runs out at 60 seconds.  
5). The Guess_Agent should guess approximately every 5 seconds. 
6). Should there be a third AI_Agent that decides if the guess is close enough?  For example, if the word to draw is “Cat”, the the Guess_Agent says “Feline” that should be an acceptable answer. 
7). Write this in HTML + JavaScript using React (with Babel) so it can run directly in the browser.  I will copy the code into Cursor and then run.  


Thanks a lot for taking the time to review it and it was really fun to work on!
